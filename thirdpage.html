<h1 style="text-align:center; margin-top:50px;">There are promising signs for emerging electric vehicle (EV) markets, albeit from a small base. why?</h1>


<p style="font-size:35px; text-align:center; line-height: 50px; margin-bottom:50px; background-color: ; padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px;  padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px; color:;">There are promising signs for emerging electric vehicle (EV) markets, albeit from a small base.<br> Electric car sales are generally low outside the major markets, but 2022 was a growth year in India, Thailand and Indonesia. Collectively, sales of electric cars in these countries more than tripled compared to 2021, reaching 80 000.<br> For Thailand, the share of electric cars in total sales came in at slightly over 3% in 2022, while both India and Indonesia averaged around 1.5% last year.<br> In India, EV and component manufacturing is ramping up, supported by the government’s USD 3.2 billion incentive programme that has attracted investments totalling USD 8.3 billion.<br> Thailand and Indonesia are also strengthening their policy support schemes, potentially providing valuable experience for other emerging market economies seeking to foster EV adoption.  </p>



<h1 style="text-align:center; margin-top:50px;">Market trends and policy efforts in major car markets are supporting a bright outlook for EV sales. why? </h1>



<p style="font-size:35px; text-align:center; line-height: 50px; margin-bottom:50px; background-color: ; padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px;  padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px; color:;">Market trends and policy efforts in major car markets are supporting a bright outlook for EV sales. Under the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the global outlook for the share of electric car sales based on existing policies and firm objectives has increased to 35% in 2030,<br> up from less than 25% in the previous outlook.<br> In the projections, China retains its position as the largest market for electric cars with 40% of total sales by 2030 in the STEPS. The United States doubles its market share to 20% by the end of the decade as recent policy announcements drive demand, while Europe maintains its current 25% share.</p>



<h1 style="text-align:center; margin-top:50px;">Battery manufacturing continues to expand, encouraged by the outlook for EVs. why?</h1>



<p style="font-size:35px; text-align:center; line-height: 50px; margin-bottom:50px; background-color: ; padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px;  padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px; color:;">Battery manufacturing continues to expand, encouraged by the outlook for EVs.<br> As of March 2023, announcements on battery manufacturing capacity delivered by 2030 are more than sufficient to meet the demand implied by government pledges and would even be able to cover the demand for electric vehicles in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.<br> It is therefore well possible that higher shares of sales are achievable for electric cars than those anticipated on the basis of current government policy and national targets.</p>



<h1 style="text-align:center; margin-top:50px;">Global spending on electric cars exceeded USD 425 billion in 2022, up 50% relative to 2021. why?</h1>


<p style="font-size:35px; text-align:center; line-height: 50px; margin-bottom:50px; background-color: ; padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px;  padding: 15px 35px 15px 35px; color:;">Only 10% of the spending can be attributed to government support, the remainder was from consumers. Investors have also maintained confidence in EVs, with the stocks of EV-related companies consistently outperforming traditional carmakers since 2019.<br> Venture capital investments in start-up firms developing EV and battery technologies have also boomed, reaching nearly USD 2.1 billion in 2022, up 30% relative to 2021, with investments increasing in batteries and critical minerals.

SUVs and large cars dominate available electric car options in 2022. They account for 60% of available BEV options in China and Europe and an even greater share in the United States, similar to the trend towards SUVs seen in internal combustion engine (ICE) car markets.<br> In 2022, ICE SUVs emitted over 1 Gt CO2, far greater than the 80 Mt net emissions reductions from the electric vehicle fleet that year.<br> Battery electric SUVs often have batteries that are two- to three-times larger than small cars, requiring more critical minerals. However, last year electric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over 150 000 barrels of oil consumption per day and avoided the associated tailpipe emissions that would have been generated through burning the fuel in combustion engines.

The electric car market is increasingly competitive. A growing number of new entrants, primarily from China but also from other emerging markets, are offering more affordable models. Major incumbent carmakers are increasing ambition as well, especially in Europe, and 2022-2023 saw another series of important EV announcements: fully electric fleets, cheaper cars, greater investment, and vertical integration with battery-making and critical minerals.

Consumers can choose from an increasing number of options for electric cars. The number of available electric car models reached 500 in 2022, more than double the options available in 2018.<br> However, outside of China, there is a need for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to offer affordable, competitively priced options in order to enable mass adoption of EVs.<br> Today’s level of available electric car models is still significantly lower than the number of ICE options on the market, but the number of ICE models available has been steadily decreasing since its peak in the mid-2010s. </p>
